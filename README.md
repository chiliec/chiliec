## Hi, I’m Vladimir 👋
**iOS Engineer • Full-Stack Explorer • Web3 Enthusiast**

I’m a **senior iOS developer (Swift / SwiftUI)** with a strong background in **mobile architecture, performance, and product thinking**.
Over the years, I’ve also worked across **backend, frontend, DevOps**, and **Web3**, which helps me see products as complete systems — not just apps.

### 🚀 What I do
- 📱 Build **high-quality iOS apps**
- 🧠 Design **clean architectures** and scalable solutions
- 🌍 Work comfortably across the stack: **mobile ↔ backend ↔ infrastructure**
- 🤖 Develop **Telegram bots** and automation tools
- 🔗 Explore **Web3 & blockchain** ecosystems
